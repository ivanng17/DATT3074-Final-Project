# DATT3074 Final Project

## Description

This is a data visualization project using JavaScript and RNBO to make an audio/visual representation of a specific data set. The data set that is being referred to comes from ClimateData.com and has to deal with the monthly numbers of average temperatures and the total precipitation that the area around the York University campus had experienced from 2014-2024. 

The visualization can be accessed here:

## Why Did I Choose This Data Set?

As someone who frequently commutes to school for hours back and forth, the weather is something I have to take into consideration as I need to figure out how much earlier I need to be to arrive on campus on time and see what I need to wear that day. <br>
I decided on this data set due to this reason and I decided to specify the area around York University to personalize the visualization.

## References

Most of the code in this repository is taken from the RNBO JS template which is found here: https://github.com/Cycling74/rnbo.example.webpage <br>
Additional code was taken from: https://www.w3schools.com/ (with specific references in the source code of this repo). <br>
In the Max/RNBO patcher, the patcher uses a gen based off of the random-integer code example from the Generating Sound and Organizing Time textbook. <br>

## Additional Notes

This repo contains the source code for the entire website.
Any additional assets are placed in the "extra-materials" folder which includes the Excel/CSV files that the data was taken from and the Max/RNBO patcher.*

*Due to running RNBO in trial mode, the patcher could not be saved, instead an alternative Max-adapted patcher has been provided and images of the original RNBO patch have been added.
